/**
 * The embeddings that we (the current client) knows how to handle.
 *
 * This is an exhaustive set of values we pass when GET-ing or PUT-ting
 * encrypted embeddings from remote. However, we should be prepared to receive a
 * {@link RemoteEmbedding} with a model value different from these.
 *
 * It is vernacularly called a model, but strictly speaking this is not the
 * model, but the embedding produced by a particular model with a particular set
 * of pre-/post- processing steps and related hyperparameters. It is better
 * thought of as an "type" of embedding produced or consumed by the client.
 *
 * [Note: Handling versioning of embeddings]
 *
 * The embeddings themselves have a version embedded in them, so it is possible
 * for us to make backward compatible updates to the indexing process on newer
 * clients (There is also a top level version field too but that is not used).
 *
 * If we bump the version of same model (say when indexing on a newer client),
 * the assumption will be that older client will be able to consume the
 * response. e.g.  Say if we improve blur detection, older client should just
 * consume embeddings with a newer version and not try to index the file again
 * locally.
 *
 * If we get an embedding with version that is older than the version the client
 * supports, then the client should ignore it. This way, the file will get
 * reindexed locally an embedding with a newer version will get put to remote.
 *
 * In the case where the changes are not backward compatible and can only be
 * consumed by clients with the relevant scaffolding, then we change this
 * "model" (i.e "type") field to create a new universe of embeddings.

 * The maximum number of items to fetch in a single GET /embeddings/diff
 *
 * [Note: Limit of returned items in /diff requests]
 *
 * The various GET /diff API methods, which tell the client what all has changed
 * since a timestamp (provided by the client) take a limit parameter.
 *
 * These diff API calls return all items whose updated at is greater
 * (non-inclusive) than the timestamp we provide. So there is no mechanism for
 * pagination of items which have the same exact updated at. Conceptually, it
 * may happen that there are more items than the limit we've provided.
 *
 * The behaviour of this limit is different for file diff and embeddings diff.
 *
 * -   For file diff, the limit is advisory, and remote may return less, equal
 *     or more items than the provided limit. The scenario where it returns more
 *     is when more files than the limit have the same updated at. Theoretically
 *     it would make the diff response unbounded, however in practice file
 *     modifications themselves are all batched. Even if the user selects all
 *     the files in their library and updates them all in one go in the UI,
 *     their client app must use batched API calls to make those updates, and
 *     each of those batches would get distinct updated at.
 *
 * -   For embeddings diff, there are no bulk updates and this limit is enforced
 *     as a maximum. While theoretically it is possible for an arbitrary number
 *     of files to have the same updated at, in practice it is not possible with
 *     the current set of APIs where clients PUT individual embeddings (the
 *     updated at is a server timestamp). And even if somehow a large number of
 *     files get the same updated at and thus get truncated in the response, it
 *     won't lead to any data loss, the client which requested that particular
 *     truncated diff will just regenerate them.

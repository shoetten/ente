/**
 * A cgroup ("cluster group") is a group of clusters (possibly containing a
 * single cluster) that the user has interacted with.
 *
 * Interactions include hiding, merging and giving a name and/or a cover photo.
 *
 * The most frequent interaction is naming a {@link FaceCluster}, which promotes
 * it to a become a {@link CGroup}. The promotion comes with the ability to be
 * synced with remote (as a "cgroup" user entity).
 *
 * There after, the user may attach more clusters to the same {@link CGroup}.
 *
 * > A named cluster group can be thought of as a "person", though this is not
 * > necessarily an accurate characterization. e.g. there can be a named cluster
 * > group that contains face clusters of pets.
 *
 * The other form of interaction is hiding. The user may hide a single (unnamed)
 * cluster, or they may hide an named {@link CGroup}. In both cases, we promote
 * the cluster to a CGroup if needed so that their request to hide gets synced.
 *
 * cgroups are synced with remote.
 *
 * While in our local representation we separately maintain clusters and link to
 * them from within CGroups by their clusterID, in the remote representation
 * clusters themselves don't get synced. Instead, the cgroup entities synced
 * with remote contain the clusters within themselves.
 *
 * That is, a cgroup that gets synced with remote looks something like:
 *
 *     { id, name, clusters: [{ clusterID, faceIDs }] }

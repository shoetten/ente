/**
 * A cgroup ("cluster group") is a group of clusters (possibly containing just a
 * single cluster) that the user has interacted with.
 *
 * Interactions include hiding, merging and giving a name and/or a cover photo.
 *
 * The most frequent interaction is naming a {@link FaceCluster}, which promotes
 * it to a become a {@link CGroup}. The promotion comes with the
 * ability to be synced with remote (as a "cgroup" user entity).
 *
 * There after, the user may attach more clusters to the same cgroup.
 *
 * > A named cluster group can be thought of as a "person", though this is not
 * > necessarily an accurate characterization. e.g. there can be a named cluster
 * > group that contains face clusters of pets.
 *
 * The other form of interaction is hiding. The user may hide a single (unnamed)
 * cluster, or they may hide an named cgroup. In both cases, we promote the
 * cluster to a cgroup if needed so that their request to hide gets synced.
 *
 * The user can see both the cgroups and clusters in the UI, but only the
 * cgroups are synced with remote.
